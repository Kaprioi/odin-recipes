        <p>Pasta is a type of dough made from flour, eggs, and sometimes water or olive oil. It is rolled out into sheets and cut into various shapes, such as spaghetti, macaroni, penne, and lasagna sheets. Pasta is typically cooked in boiling water until al dente, meaning it is tender but still has a slight bite. It can be served with a variety of sauces, such as tomato sauce, pesto, or Alfredo sauce, and can be topped with cheese, vegetables, or meat.</p>
