        <p>Rice pudding is a comforting and creamy dessert made by simmering rice in milk until it becomes tender and thickened. It is often flavored with sugar, vanilla, and spices like cinnamon or nutmeg. Rice pudding can be served warm or cold, and it is sometimes topped with whipped cream, fruit, or a sprinkle of cinnamon. The texture of rice pudding is smooth and creamy, with a subtle sweetness that is balanced by the richness of the milk.</p>
